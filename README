This engine was ported into scummvm, please use scummvm implementation because it better
https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm


[Needed lib's]
SDL
SDL_image
SDL_mixer
SDL_gfx
SDL_ttf

[Build targets:]
linux_zgi
linux_zgi_trace
linux_znem
linux_znem_trace
win32_zgi_trace
win32_zgi
win32_znem_trace
win32_znem

Targets trace - for output to stdout debug info about what scripts actions is doing now.

zgi - Zork Grand Inquisitor
znem - Zork Nemesis

win32 targets is for building by mingw, I use cross-compilation, you need to correct paths in Makefile.


cd Engine/src/

make *target*



[Useful things]
- You may change gamma level by "CTRL"+"+" and "CTRL"+"-"
- For run in fullscreen use -f key
- Switch to fullscreen ALT+ENTER
- You may run game binary file with "path/to/game/resources" parameter, but game saves will be in current dir.


[How to run it:]
For running games you need original games.

1. Copy files from disks likes as on windows (http://home.earthlink.net/~infernofilecabinet4/XpSetupsU_Z/Guest/zorkgiCD.htm).

2. Create folder "FONTS" and copy needed fonts(at least one file)

3. Create file Zork.dir (or try one from "conf" dir) and write to this file releative paths to folder with resources and to *.zfs file
   Each entry must by splited by new line
   
   Example:
   Addon
   Addon/subpatch.zfs
   ZNEMSCR/ASCR.ZFS
   ZNEMSCR/GSCR.ZFS
   ZNEMSCR/CURSOR.ZFS
   ZNEMSCR/CSCR.ZFS
   ZNEMSCR/TSCR.ZFS
   ZNEMSCR/ESCR.ZFS
   ZNEMSCR/VSCR.ZFS
   ZNEMSCR/MSCR.ZFS
   ZASSETS
   ZASSETS/ENDGAME
   ZASSETS/CONSERV
   ZASSETS/GLOBAL
   ZASSETS/GLOBAL/VENUS
   ZASSETS/GLOBAL2
   ZASSETS/MONAST
   ZASSETS/GLOBAL3
   ZASSETS/CASTLE
   ZASSETS/TEMPLE
   ZASSETS/ASYLUM

4. For Nemesis you need to copy res/MIDI folder to game dir.
